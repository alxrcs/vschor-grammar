# vschor-grammar

This is a small extension for working with G-choreographies in VSCode.

A description of the language and syntax can be found 
[here](https://bitbucket.org/eMgssi/chorgram/wiki/Home).

## Features

* Basic syntax highlighting for .gc and .fsa files.
* Minimal snippets for easier editing.
* Auto .gc and .fsa preview on save
* Menu options for projection and LTS generation

## TODO
* More robust error detection for dependencies (currently assumes Chorgram is installed)
* Expand the set of Chorgram commands available
